## Introduction

Welcome to the Algorand PyTeal Dockerized Development Environment project! This repository has been created with the primary goal of simplifying the process of setting up, developing, and testing Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1s) in PyTeal.

Building decentralized applications on the Algorand blockchain requires precise setup and coordination of various tools and dependencies. This can be quite complex and time-consuming. More importantly, differences in development environments can lead to inconsistencies that make it harder for teams to collaborate efficiently.

This project leverages the power of Docker and VS Code's DevContainers to provide a fully configured, isolated, and consistent development environment with all the tools you need to develop ASC1s in PyTeal. With this setup, you can quickly start your development work without worrying about installing and configuring your local development environment.

This Dockerized environment can also be easily shared, ensuring that all team members, no matter their operating system or installed software, can contribute efficiently and consistently.

Whether you are a seasoned Algorand developer or a beginner who is just starting to explore the world of blockchain and smart contracts, this project is designed to get you up and running quickly, and to make your development experience as smooth and efficient as possible.

## Quick Start

> To just pull the latest version of the container:

``` sh
docker pull blockfoundation/algorand-pyteal-devcontainer
